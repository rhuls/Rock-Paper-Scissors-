Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple, clean interface and two different game modes: a single-player mode against the computer and a two-player mode to play with a friend.

Features
Vs. Computer Mode: Play against a random-choice AI opponent.

2-Player Mode: Play a local match against a friend, with a simple mechanism to hide Player 1's choice until Player 2 has made their move.

Score Tracking: The scoreboard keeps a running tally of wins, losses, and draws for the current game mode.

Animations: The game includes simple shake animations to simulate the classic "throwing" motion of the hands.
